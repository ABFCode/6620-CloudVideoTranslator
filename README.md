# 6620-CloudVideoTranslator


# POC

- Story 1: As a User, I need to submit a YouTube video URL to a web interface so that I can initiate the translation process.
- Story 2: As the System, I need to fetch the existing English transcript from a YouTube video so that I have the source text for translation, avoiding the need for expensive/complicated audio processing.
- Story 3: As the System, I need to translate the fetched transcript into a target language using an AI or ML service. 
- Story 4: As a User, I need to be able to view or download the final translated text file so that I can use the output.


# MVP

- Story 5: As a User, I need to upload my own video file (e.g., .mp4) so that I can get translations for content that isn't on YouTube.
- Story 6: As the System, I need to automatically transcribe the audio from an uploaded video file so that I can create a source transcript from scratch.
- Story 7: As the System, I need to orchestrate the multi-step process of transcribing, translating, and formatting so that the workflow is reliable.
- Story 8: As a User, I need to receive the final translated subtitles in a standard format so that I can easily use them with standard video players.
